### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Davide Lionetti from :it: and I'm currently pursuing my M. Sc. in Music and Acoustic Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Milan. 

I'm particularly passionate about audio and music :sound: :musical_note: these are my main interests:

- **Plugin development** merged with **Machine learning** and **Deep learning**, especially vst instrument creation as I did in two of my project the [Handmonizer, an artist oriented vocal harmonizer](https://github.com/EllDy96/Handmonizer) and the [handy fm synthesizer](https://github.com/EllDy96/ComputerMusicProjects/tree/Homework3).
- **Creative programming** for New media art development focused on the user interaction like the artistic VR experience project [3Dreams](https://github.com/EllDy96/3Dreams).
- **Computer Music** software development as the [Synesthetic](https://github.com/EllDy96/Synesthetic) or the [Flanger vst plugin implemented in Juce](https://github.com/EllDy96/ComputerMusicProjects/tree/Homework2).
- Machine learning and deep learning for audio application, especialy for **audio synthesis**, **music information retrival** and **alghorithmic composition** as I did in the bachelor degree IT engineering thesis hosted by Antonio RodÃ  and entitled 
*Elaboration of a Lead Sheet Dataset for Computational Creativity Systems*. 
- Playing guitar ðŸŽ¸  sing  :microphone: and compose music :musical_score: .
- Reading :books:. 
- Doing sports :running_man:.
