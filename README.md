### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Davide Lionetti from :it: and I have pursued my M. Sc. in Music and Acoustic Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Milan with a final grade of 107/110. Have a look of my final Thesis: [Final Thesis](https://github.com/EllDy96/Augmented-Guitar-Pedalboard)

I am a life-long, passionate musician with the aim to merge my digital signal processing
studies with my musician side. 
I am resilient, constant, patient, cheerful, and positive. I love the collaboration in developing innovative and cutting-edge audio applications. 

My main interest span these two fields:
1. **Music interaction design** and human-machine
interaction, which I did in one of my projects called [Handmonizer](https://github.com/EllDy96/Handmonizer).
2. **Music information retrieval** based on deep learning, for which I have already
developed a project called [3Dreams](https://github.com/EllDy96/3Dreams). You can watch a [short video demostration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UsGnPmJvErldBg71jrULoDFW9Uel0gET/view?usp=sharing) of the last workshop in which the artist tried to merge the Handmonizer with her current setup, or read the full [scientific paper](https://github.com/EllDy96/Handmonizer/blob/main/Report/handMonizer_paper_IS2_2023.pdf) **presented at the 4th Symposium of the Internet Of Sound in Pisa**. 

I'm particularly passionate about audio and music :sound: :musical_note: these are my main interests that come to life in my projects:

- **Plugin development** merged with **Machine learning** and **Deep learning**, especially vst development linked with **Music interaction design** as I did in two of my project the [Handmonizer, an artist oriented vocal harmonizer](https://github.com/EllDy96/Handmonizer) and the [handy fm synthesizer](https://github.com/EllDy96/ComputerMusicProjects/tree/Homework3).
- **Creative programming merged with Deep learning**  for New media art development focused on the user interaction like the artistic VR experience [3Dreams](https://github.com/EllDy96/3Dreams) based on a Music emotion recognition network to track the emotional contour of a song.
- **Computer Music** software development as the [Synesthetic](https://github.com/EllDy96/Synesthetic) or the [Flanger vst plugin implemented in Juce](https://github.com/EllDy96/ComputerMusicProjects/tree/Homework2).
- Machine learning and deep learning for audio application, especialy for **audio synthesis**, **music information retrival** and **alghorithmic composition** as I did in the bachelor degree IT engineering thesis hosted by Antonio RodÃ  and entitled 
[*Elaboration of a Lead Sheet Dataset for Computational Creativity Systems*](https://github.com/EllDy96/AlgorithmicComposer). 
- Playing guitar ðŸŽ¸  sing  :microphone: and compose music :musical_score: .
- Reading and poetry :books:. 
- Doing sports as martial arts and Chalistenics :running_man:.
