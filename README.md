### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Davide Lionetti is an audio-software engineer, musician, and PhD candidate at IPEM, Ghent University, specializing in the intersection of musicology and Human-Computer Interaction. 
With a background in IT Engineering (B.Sc. at UniPD) and Music Engineering (M.Sc. at PoliMi), he has expertise in digital signal processing, deep learning, and creative programming for augmented musical instruments.

He is passionate about integrating Extended Reality and computational creativity into immersive applications. Skilled in programming languages like Python, PureData, and SuperCollider, Davide leverages his multidisciplinary musical knowledge to advance smart musical instruments and music interaction design.

Davide has developed cutting-edge Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) such as the [Handmonizer](https://github.com/EllDy96/Handmonizer) (presented at IS2-2023) and the  [Muscle Guided Guitar Pedalboard](https://github.com/EllDy96/Augmented-Guitar-Pedalboard)(featured at NIME 2024). The latest, explores the application of deep learning-based sEMG analysis to enhance audio effects.

His main interests spans these two fields:
1. **Human-computer Interaction applied to Music technology**: [Handmonizer](https://github.com/EllDy96/Handmonizer), **presented at the 4th Symposium of the Internet Of Sound in Pisa**. We designed, for the jazz singer Maria Pia De Vito, an artistic-oriented musical instrument driven by an ANN.  You can watch a [short video demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UsGnPmJvErldBg71jrULoDFW9Uel0gET/view?usp=sharing) of the last workshop in which the artist tried to merge the Handmonizer with her current setup or read the full [scientific paper](https://github.com/EllDy96/Handmonizer/blob/main/Report/handMonizer_paper_IS2_2023.pdf). 
2. **Deep learning applied to music technologies**, for which I have already
developed some projects, such as: [The Augmented Guitarist](https://github.com/EllDy96/Augmented-Guitar-Pedalboard) and [3Dreams: an immersive VR experience](https://github.com/EllDy96/3Dreams).

These are his other interests:

- **Plugin development** merged with **Machine learning** and **Deep learning**, especially VST development linked with **Music interaction design** as I did in two of my projects the [Handmonizer, an artist-oriented vocal harmonizer](https://github.com/EllDy96/Handmonizer) and the [handy fm synthesizer](https://github.com/EllDy96/ComputerMusicProjects/tree/Homework3).
- **Creative programming merged with Deep learning**  for New media art development focused on the user interaction like the artistic VR experience [3Dreams](https://github.com/EllDy96/3Dreams) based on a Music emotion recognition network to track the emotional contour of a song.
- **Computer Music** software development as the [Synesthetic](https://github.com/EllDy96/Synesthetic) or the [Flanger vst plugin implemented in Juce](https://github.com/EllDy96/ComputerMusicProjects/tree/Homework2).
- Machine learning and deep learning for audio application, especially for **audio synthesis**, **music information retrieval** and **algorithmic composition** as I did in the bachelor's degree IT engineering thesis hosted by Antonio RodÃ  and entitled 
[*Elaboration of a Lead Sheet Dataset for Computational Creativity Systems*](https://github.com/EllDy96/AlgorithmicComposer). 
- Playing guitar ðŸŽ¸  sing  :microphone: and produce music in Ableton :musical_score:. Check his [song in Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/1a0eYHiIP3VTMvnnqeC9N4?si=49eaf9024101417f)
- Reading and poetry :books:. 
- Doing sports such as martial arts and Chalistenics :running_man:.
