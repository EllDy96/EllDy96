### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Davide Lionetti from :it: and I have pursued my M. Sc. in Music and Acoustic Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Milan with a final grade of 107/110. Please have a look at my final Thesis where I developed a strategy to augment a guitarist with wearable sensors: [Final Thesis](https://github.com/EllDy96/Augmented-Guitar-Pedalboard)

I am a lifelong, passionate musician aiming to merge my engineering
studies with my musician side. I am resilient, constant, patient, cheerful, and positive. I love the collaboration in developing innovative and cutting-edge audio applications. 

My main interests span these two fields:
1. **Human-computer Interaction applied to Music technology**: Have a look at my project called [Handmonizer](https://github.com/EllDy96/Handmonizer), **presented at the 4th Symposium of the Internet Of Sound in Pisa**. We designed, for the jazz singer Maria Pia De Vito, an artistic-oriented musical instrument driven by an ANN.  You can watch a [short video demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UsGnPmJvErldBg71jrULoDFW9Uel0gET/view?usp=sharing) of the last workshop in which the artist tried to merge the Handmonizer with her current setup or read the full [scientific paper](https://github.com/EllDy96/Handmonizer/blob/main/Report/handMonizer_paper_IS2_2023.pdf). 
2. **Deep learning applied to music technologies**, for which I have already
developed some projects, such as: [The Augmented Guitarist](https://github.com/EllDy96/Augmented-Guitar-Pedalboard) and [3Dreams: an immersive VR experience](https://github.com/EllDy96/3Dreams).

I'm particularly passionate about audio and music :sound: :musical_note: these are my main interests that come to life in my projects:

- **Plugin development** merged with **Machine learning** and **Deep learning**, especially VST development linked with **Music interaction design** as I did in two of my projects the [Handmonizer, an artist-oriented vocal harmonizer](https://github.com/EllDy96/Handmonizer) and the [handy fm synthesizer](https://github.com/EllDy96/ComputerMusicProjects/tree/Homework3).
- **Creative programming merged with Deep learning**  for New media art development focused on the user interaction like the artistic VR experience [3Dreams](https://github.com/EllDy96/3Dreams) based on a Music emotion recognition network to track the emotional contour of a song.
- **Computer Music** software development as the [Synesthetic](https://github.com/EllDy96/Synesthetic) or the [Flanger vst plugin implemented in Juce](https://github.com/EllDy96/ComputerMusicProjects/tree/Homework2).
- Machine learning and deep learning for audio application, especially for **audio synthesis**, **music information retrieval** and **algorithmic composition** as I did in the bachelor's degree IT engineering thesis hosted by Antonio RodÃ  and entitled 
[*Elaboration of a Lead Sheet Dataset for Computational Creativity Systems*](https://github.com/EllDy96/AlgorithmicComposer). 
- Playing guitar ðŸŽ¸  sing  :microphone: and compose music :musical_score: .
- Reading and poetry :books:. 
- Doing sports such as martial arts and Chalistenics :running_man:.
